Graph Teminologies:
-------------------

1. Vertex - It is a point where multiple lines meet. Also called as node.
2. Edge - It is a line that connects two vertices.
3. Degree Of Vertex - A degree of vertex is the number of edges connected to it.
4. Parallel Edges - If two vertices are connected by more than one edges such edges are clalled as parallel edges.

Graph Traversal:
----------------
Graph traversal referes to visiting each vertex and edge in the graph only once in well defined order. 
Graph traversal methods are:
1. Breadth First Serach
2. Depth First Serach
3. Binary Search Tree

Breadth First Search:
---------------------
Start from source node and traverse the graph layer wise.
I) First move horizontally and visit all the nodes in current layer
II) Move to the next layesr and repeat the steps above
BFS always finds shortest path to the goal.
However for larger and complex graphs, its performance is very slow and it takes mpore memory.
