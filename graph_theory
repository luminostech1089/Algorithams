Graph Teminologies:

1. Vertex - It is a point where multiple lines meet. Also called as node.
2. Edge - It is a line that connects two vertices.
3. Degree Of Vertex - A degree of vertex is the number of edges connected to it.
4. Parallel Edges - If two vertices are connected by more than one edges such edges are clalled as parallel edges.
